I'm Sean Peyres (@smpeyres), an undergradaute research assistant at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
Currently pursuing a BS in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering
Concentration in Plasma & Fusion Science & Engineering; Minor in Physics

I am co-advised by: 
1. Prof. R. Mohan Sankaran (Synthesis, Plasma, Energy, Conversion Lab)
2. Prof. Davide Curreli (Laboratory of Computational Plasma Physics)

I have been personally tutored and mentored by:
1. Nabiel Abuyazid (UIUC CHBE PhD student)
2. Dr. Shane Keniley (UIUC NPRE PhD alum, currently at Lam Research)

I am interested in modeling the complex chemistry and physics of low-temperature, atmospheric pressure plasmas
I focus primarily on fluid models (ie drift-diffusion) and global plasma models (GPMs)
My tool of the trade is ZAPDOS-CRANE, an open-source suite of applications for the MOOSE framework

Regarding programming, I'm currently learning how to automate my workflows with python scripts and becoming more proficient with git
