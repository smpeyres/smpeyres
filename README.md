I'm Sean M. Peyres (@smpeyres), an undergradaute research assistant at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

Currently pursuing a BS in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering 

Concentration in Plasma & Fusion Science & Engineering; Minor in Physics

I am co-advised by: 
1. Prof. R. Mohan Sankaran (Synthesis, Plasma, Energy, Conversion Lab)
2. Prof. Davide Curreli (Laboratory of Computational Plasma Physics)

I have been personally mentored by:
1. Dr. Nabiel Abuyazid (UIUC CHBE PhD alum, currently postdoc at UIUC)
2. Dr. Shane Keniley (UIUC NPRE PhD alum, currently at Lam Research)
3. Asst. Prof. Necip Üner (UIUC NPRE Post-Doc and Visiting Faculty, currently at METU)

I am interested in modeling the chemistry of low-temperature, atmospheric pressure plasma and plasma-liquid interactions.
Current research includes reaction-diffusion modeling of the plasma-liquid interface. 

I am currently the lead maintainer of the CRANE repository. https://github.com/lcpp-org/crane
